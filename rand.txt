Flow control and congestion management is one of the most important features of WebRTC. 

WebRTC connections start with the lowest bandwidth configured and slowly ramps up to the maximum available bandwidth, 
or to the higher limit the exploration range in case no bandwidth limitation is detected. 

Notice that WebRtcEndpoints in Kurento are designed in a way that multiple WebRTC connections fed by the same stream
share quality. When a new connection is added, as it requires to start with low bandwidth, it will cause the rest of
connections to experience a transient period of degraded quality, until it stabilizes its bitrate. 

This doesn't apply when transcoding is involved.
Transcoders will adjust their output bitrate based in bandwidth requirements, 
but it won't affect the original stream. 

If an incoming WebRTC stream needs to be transcoded, for whatever reason, 
all WebRtcEndpoints fed from transcoder output will share a separate quality 
than the ones connected directly to the original stream.
